<h1>EddieBauer Clone</h1>

This project is a clone of the EddieBauer e-commerce website, created as a learning exercise and to showcase my skills as a developer. The clone aims to replicate the key features and functionalities of the original EddieBauer website.

<h1>Key Features</h1>

User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens to ensure secure access to user-specific features.

Product Catalog: A comprehensive catalog of products, categorized by different departments, allowing users to browse and search for items. Each product page displays detailed information, including price, description, and available sizes.
